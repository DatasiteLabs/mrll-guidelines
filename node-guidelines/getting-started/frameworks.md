| Getting started              | Getting started is relatively easy - there are a lot of tutorials and it is a mature framework.                                                                 | It is similar enough to Express that users can switch over. The use of async functions might need some training.                                                        | There is a fair bit of abstraction - it is very similar to Angular in that sense. It also uses typescript by default and is modeled after Angular.                        | Express          |
| Syntax sugar and helpers     | There is no provided syntax sugar. A lot of functions still use callbacks, though Promises are supported in most cases.                                         | Async/await is the predominant pattern in the code and it makes things a bit easier to read; but error handling still needs a lot of attention.                         | There is a lot of sugar provided e.g. Decorators for controllers; this allows the developer to use the prescribed way of doing things rather than to code things by hand. | Nest             |
| Out of the box functionality | A basic server with routing is possible. You need to have middleware to do anything more than this (body parser to help with JSON payloads, etc.)               | Koa is very minimal by design - you need to install middleware to make it do anything else                                                                              | Nest is built on top of Express and includes a lot of out of the box functionality. Similar to Angular, it comes with a lot built in.                                     | Nest             |
| Documentation                | Documentation is thorough and maintained - versioning is available.                                                                                             | Documentation is present but not versioned. The descriptions are also generated and not in-depth and descriptive. It is more of a reference for methods and properties. | Documentation is good and versioned.                                                                                                                                      | Express and Nest |
| Performance                  | Performance with Express is generally good - it largely depends on the number of middleware functions in use and routing configuration (developer code ignored) | Performance is the main focus                                                                                                                                           | Performance is good                                                                                                                                                       | Koa              |

| Ease of finding developers   | Easy                                                                                                                                                            | Hard to find people with direct experience but there is a fair amount of transferable skill from Express                                                                | It is a new framework so there won't be developers with direct experience                                                                                                 | Express          |

### Verdict

Each framework has a different focus: performance, ubiquity, syntax sugar, etc. Nest is a useful framework due to its help with syntax - decorators, use of explicit controllers, etc. However, due to it being relatively new and the fact that it is built on top of Express we are not recommending its use just yet.

Express being a more mature framework means that there are more developers who are experienced with production experience. This, along with the size of the ecosystem and available help for new developers, is one of the main reasons. for recommending Express.
