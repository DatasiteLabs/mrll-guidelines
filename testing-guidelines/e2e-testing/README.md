## e2e Tests

1. **Confirms Your Application Health**: End-to-end testing will validate that your software is functional at every level – from the front to back-end and on multiple systems – as well as provide perspective on its performance across different environments.
2. **Expands Test Coverage**: By incorporating the many different sub systems in your testing process, you’ll effectively expand your test coverage and create additional test cases that may have not previously been considered.
3. **Detects Bugs & Increases Application Productivity**: In end-to-end testing, software is usually tested after every iteration, meaning you’ll be able to find and fix any issues faster. This will reduce the chances of bugs making it further into the testing process (and also production), thereby ensuring the application workflows operate seamlessly.
4. **Reduces Testing Efforts & Costs**: With fewer bugs, breakdowns, and comprehensive testing each step of the way, end-to-end testing will also decrease your need to repeat tests, and ultimately, the costs and time associated with doing so.
